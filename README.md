Leela V0.25.1 Cuda works only with the enclosed small and default network?

As newby I donwloaded version 25 and installed it on my computer with CUDA application. Everything works fine with the enclosed small network default. But changing the default network with a bigger network no moves are produced through the enigine. Is there someone who recognise this and how I can overcome this problem?
